	 * Basic implementation of a ViewStack container targeting the Spark environment.
	 * CBViewStack inherently supports deferred instantiation. All methods and properties
	 * have been made protected in order to subclass and implement any desired creation 
	 * policy.
	 * 
	 * Child content cannot be added in markup due to the black-boxing of the mxmlContent and 
	 * mxmlContentFactory properties and corresponding methods. As such, supply content to the
	 * CBViewStack using the <b>content</b> property. The <b>content</b> property is an array
	 * of declared IVisibleElement instances.
	 * 
	 * To enable scrolling of content added to the display list of CBViewStack, it is recommended
	 * the either programatically control the viewport with an external scrollbar or wrap the 
	 * container in a <s :Scroller> instance.
	 * 
	 * The <b>content</b> and <b>selectedIndex</b> properties can be set in-line in MXML.
	 * The <b>selectedChild</b> property can only be set within ActionScript.
	 * 
	 * <example>
	 * 
	 * <fx :Declarations>
	 *     <s :Group id="child1" width="200" height="300" />
	 *     <s :Group id="child2" width="200" height="300" />
	 *     <s :Group id="child3" width="200" height="300" />
	 * </fx>
	 * 
	 * <s :Scroller width="100%" height="100%">
	 *     <cb :CBViewStack content="{[child1,child2,child3]}" selectedIndex="2" />
	 * </s>
